The error log you provided indicates a few issues encountered while trying to run a Node.js application, specifically related to using Vite, a build tool for frontend development.

Breakdown of the Error Log:
ExperimentalWarning:

This warning indicates that the CommonJS module is trying to load an ES Module using require(). This is an experimental feature in Node.js and may not work reliably. While this is just a warning and may not be the direct cause of your issue, it suggests that there might be compatibility issues with how modules are being imported.
Project Name and Directory:

The log shows that the project name was prompted but the current directory is not empty. The user chose to cancel the operation. This means that the setup process for creating a new Vite project was interrupted.
'vite' is not recognized:

This error indicates that the command line interface cannot find the vite command. This usually means that Vite is not installed globally or not installed in the current project.
Unknown command:

The last part of the log shows that the command task-management-system@0.0.0 is not recognized. This typically happens when trying to run a script that is not defined in the package.json or if the command is mistyped.
Solutions:
Ensure Vite is Installed:

First, check if Vite is installed in your project. If not, you can install it using npm:
bash
Insert Code
Edit
Copy code
npm install vite --save-dev
If you want to use Vite globally, you can install it globally:
bash
Insert Code
Edit
Copy code
npm install -g vite
Check Your Project Directory:

Since the directory is not empty, make sure that you are in the correct directory for your project. If you intended to create a new project, consider moving to an empty directory or removing the existing files if they are not needed.
Run the Correct Command:

If you have a script defined in your package.json, make sure to run it with:
bash
Insert Code
Edit
Copy code
npm run <script-name>
Replace <script-name> with the actual script name defined in your package.json.
Check Your package.json:

Open your package.json file and ensure that the scripts section includes the commands you want to run. It should look something like this:
json
Insert Code
Edit
Copy code
"scripts": {
  "dev": "vite",
  "build": "vite build"
}
Clear Node Modules and Reinstall:

If issues persist, you might want to delete the node_modules folder and the package-lock.json file, and then run:
bash
Insert Code
Edit
Copy code
npm install
By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issues indicated in the error log and successfully run your Vite project.
